1. Write a program which initializes 2 variables and then swaps their values.
2. Write a program which counts the number of digits in an integer.
3. Write a function with signature bool checkDate(const char* text), which verifies if the input parameter is a correct date in DD.MM 
   format. Do not use string.
4. Write a function which checks whether a string is а substring in another string. If true, the functions must return the index to
   the first position the substring is located in the string, else return -1.
